Hi,

I notice that in the final model function there is the below code where the number of minibatches is computed,

"num_minibatches = int(m / minibatch_size) # number of minibatches of size minibatch_size in the train set"

This does not take into account the offset when the training set/batch size is not an exact multiple of the minibatch size (in this case m = 1080 & minibatch_size = 32 which will entail an additional last mini-batch of 24 examples).

Won't this affect the epoch cost values since we use the above to take the average of the mini batch costs in each epoch? or am I missing something basic here.

Also can't the above computation be moved out of the loop to be just above the epoch loop since it doesn't change with the loop & is repeatedly computed?

Any one?

Thanks
Muthu
